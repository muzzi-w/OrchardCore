# Orchard Core 3.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

Before upgrading from version 2 to v3, it is important to first compile your project using the latest available v2 version, resolve any warnings, and then proceed with the upgrade to v3.

## Breaking Changes

### GraphQL Module

#### GraphQL Library Upgrade

The `GraphQL` libraries have been upgraded from version 7 to version 8. Below are important changes and considerations for your implementation:

1. **Removal of Default Implementation**:  
   The `IContentTypeBuilder` interface previously included a default implementation for the `Clear()` method. This implementation has been removed. If you have a custom implementation of `IContentTypeBuilder`, you must now provide your own `Clear()` method. The method can remain empty if no specific actions are needed.

2. **Sealed Classes**:  
   Several classes have been marked as sealed to prevent further inheritance. This change is intended to enhance stability and maintainability. The following classes are now sealed:

   - All implementations of `InputObjectGraphType`
   - All implementations of `ObjectGraphType<>`
   - All implementations of `WhereInputObjectGraphType`
   - All implementations of `DynamicContentTypeBuilder`
   - All implementations of `IContentTypeBuilder`
   - All implementations of `GraphQLFilter`
   - All implementations of `ISchemaBuilder`

### Users Module

The user registration and login functionalities have been refactored for better extensibility:

- **Registration Improvements**:  
  - The `IRegistrationFormEvents` interface now includes `Task RegisteringAsync(UserRegisteringContext context)` for streamlined customization.  
  - A new base class, `RegistrationFormEventsBase`, allows developers to override only necessary methods.

- **Login Improvements**:  
  - The `ILoginFormEvent` interface has a new method: `Task<IActionResult> ValidatingLoginAsync(IUser user)`.  
  - The `LoginFormEventBase` class enables overriding relevant methods. Note that the base implementation of `LoggingInAsync()` has been removed; you must now implement this method if using `LoginFormEventBase`.

- **User Service Update**:  
  - A new method in `IUserService` interface: `Task<IUser> RegisterAsync(RegisterUserForm model, Action<string, string> reportError)` facilitates registration with error reporting.

These enhancements make the user management system more modular and customizable.

#### Removed old settings

The following obsolete settings were removed from `RegistrationSettings` class

- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers`
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers`
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers`
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername`
- `GenerateUsernameScript`
- `UsersCanRegister`

The following obsolete settings were removed from `LoginSettings` class

- `UseExternalProviderIfOnlyOneDefined`
- `UseScriptToSyncRoles`
- `SyncRolesScript`

#### Login View Update

The `ExternalLogin` action has been removed from the `Account` controller. If you are using a custom `Login.cshtml` view or `Login` template, please update the external login form action. As of this update, the `ExternalLogin` action has been relocated to the `ExternalAuthentications` controller.

#### AssignRoleToUsers Permission Update

The `AssignRoleToUsers` permission is no longer implicitly granted by `EditUsers`. To maintain the same behavior, make sure to explicitly assign the `AssignRoleToUsers` permission to any role that already has the `EditUsers` permission.
